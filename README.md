## Intorduction

The Chess Game project is designed to provide an engaging, interactive, and user-friendly experience for chess enthusiasts. The game follows the traditional rules of chess, allowing players to move pieces according to the game's established rules. The application is developed using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure it runs smoothly on various browsers and devices.

This project also serves as a learning experience in building front-end web applications, particularly focusing on interactivity, game logic, and responsive design.
